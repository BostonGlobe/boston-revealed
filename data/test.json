The sheer volume of the president's deceits, and his administration's, has been chronicled elsewhere — from <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html>a running tally by The New York Times</a> to the <a href=http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/pants-fire/>many \"pants on fire!\" claims compiled by PolitiFact</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"What's also noteworthy, though, is the distinct pattern that Trump’s lies follow. It starts with a falsehood, and continues as the administration attempts to obfuscate both the lie and the truth. Then there's a grudging admission the lie was a lie, and finally an attempt to shrug off the subject. This pattern often unfolds quickly; the president routinely comes out and admits things on Twitter that his spokespeople have been denying for hours or days."},{"type":"text","value":"Ironically, the pattern echoes a well-known cycle in public relations — response to an event, recovery, mitigation, and preparedness for the next event. The stream of flimflammery coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has created a new paradigm: the lie cycle."},{"type":"text","value":"Nearly seven months into Trump's term, this cycle is so established that it's a useful predictor of future behavior, and not just to American voters. Foreign adversaries can see that, when Trump is in a bind, he blusters in easily disprovable ways. With its credibility in tatters, this White House is playing poker with a tell."},{"type":"text","value":"Consider four of the White House’s biggest falsehoods:"}],"sections":[{"section":"Lie","number":"1","events":[{"topic":"Russia","subevents":[{"description":"“I have nothing to do with Russia.
